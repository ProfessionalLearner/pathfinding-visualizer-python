# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! The given python 
program visualizes pathfinding algorithms in
action on 2D grid. Five algorithms are available 
for visualization: A*, Dijkstra, Best First Search, Breadth First Search, 
Depth First Search. Choose an algorithm, mark start and 
end, add barriers, and visualize execution of the algorithm.
